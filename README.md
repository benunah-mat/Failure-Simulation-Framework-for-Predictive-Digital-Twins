# Failure Simulation Framework for Predictive Digital Twins

## Overview

The **Failure Simulation Framework for Predictive Digital Twins** is a physics-based predictive maintenance platform designed to simulate equipment degradation, monitor asset health, detect faults, and predict machine failures.

This framework integrates digital twin simulation with predictive maintenance analytics to support industrial asset reliability and maintenance decision-making.

The system models machine degradation, generates synthetic vibration signals, detects anomalies, and estimates remaining useful life (RUL).

## Applications

The framework is designed for predictive maintenance and reliability analysis in industries operating mechanical systems such as:

• Oil & Gas
• Energy and Power Generation
• Manufacturing
• Mining
• Aerospace
• Industrial rotating machinery

## Example Use Case

Industrial operators can use the framework to simulate machine degradation and predict failure under different operating conditions.

Example output:

Machine 3 → Failure predicted in 4200 hours
Machine 1 → Failure predicted in 6100 hours
Machine 4 → Failure predicted in 7800 hours

This enables maintenance teams to prioritize asset servicing before failure occurs.
